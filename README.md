# MattsGame3.0
Retro RPG style game made completely from scratch. 
Final name still undecided as we are still in very early alpha stages of development.
No game-making tools or external libraries used. Only tool used was the e(fx)clipse plugin for Eclipse.
I wanted to challenge myself while learning more about program design, so I started making this game for fun in my free time.
It has come a long way over these last few months and I am working to eventually get it onto a gaming platform such as Steam.
